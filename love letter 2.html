            <p>Dear Sarah,</p>

            <p>I know this is something different from the real traditional, but I have never even written a letter for someone else before. Disclaimer: I just want you to know how I feel. I may use simple words, but this is true. I hope you’re doing okay. I just wanted to write something honestly, without pressure, without expecting anything, just something from me to you.</p>

            <p>“I want you to know that getting to know you has been one of the softest parts of my days. You’re quiet at first, but once you’re comfortable, you turn into someone surprisingly talkative, funny, and warm in your own way. And even if I don’t really see your smile, Making you laugh with me while we play games is enough. Sometimes I act dumb on purpose just to make you smile, it’s one of the things I didn’t realize I’d end up caring about.</p>

            <p>I remember back then that I didn't care about emotions, and I despised all of that. I just grew up not valuing things. I just know if you try hard, you will get there, or you will achieve something that you work hard for, but I don't acknowledge it. But when I met you, I just saw another view that I didn't even look at. Something like that will change how I view things more differently, more logically. That's why I'm very thankful that I met you, Commander.</p>

            <p>You don’t need to explain yourself or pretend to be okay when you’re not. I understand that you have your own world, your own pace, and your own battles. I’m not here to rush you or pull you out of anything. I care about you sincerely. If I ever make mistakes, I hope you can let me know, so I can be better for you.</p>

            <p>Despite all that, I may never find the words beautiful enough to describe all that you mean to me, but I will spend the rest of my life searching for them.</p>

            <p>Merry Christmas, Commander!!</p>

            <p>After you click this link please rotate your phone into landscape for better experience, Thank you!! (If you double click the letter it will close the envelope, it just one of the features i added)</p>
